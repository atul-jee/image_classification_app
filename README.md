# Image Upload and Classification

This project is a web application for uploading images via drag-and-drop or file selection, which then predicts the content of the image using a machine learning model. 
It includes an Express.js backend and a frontend built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

## Features

- **Drag and Drop Image Upload**: Easily upload images by dragging them into the designated area or clicking to select.
- **Image Preview**: Displays a preview of the uploaded image.
- **Server-Side Prediction**: Uses a Python script to classify the image and predict the content using a pre-trained model.
- **Real-Time Feedback**: Provides the predicted result as an alert after uploading.
